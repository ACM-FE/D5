> DAY 1:
> • me and zac brainstormed about historical S.T.E.A.M icons
> • we came up with several good ideas, the best of which being:
>     - a walk through the work of dante aligheri in the style of his famous poem 'Inferno'
>     - a survival horror game set in the world and style of junji ito
> • we chose the junji ito idea, as the other one (while really fun and interesting), would take wayyy too much time that we don't have

> DAY 2:
> • i've begun organizing a schedule and board of the things that we're gonna need to do, and tomorrow will begin delegating
> • the notes here are also being sent to our discord channel to keep everyone up to speed, and i will write them up in neat to show our thought process and to make a post-mortem easier

> DAY 5:
> • after a break, i'm back at organization and i'm setting up a github repo, including a roadmap and timeline
> ![[roadmap.png]] 

> DAY 7:
> • whole idea is changed. we are now doing nikola tesla.
> • whoops.
