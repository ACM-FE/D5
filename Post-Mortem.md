## Foreword
Out of all the projects I have submitted this year, D5 is the one I have the most regrets about. It is riddled with flaws and oversights that are glaringly obvious, should have been vetoed in the earliest stages of conception, and most annoyingly are mostly, if not all my fault. This will likely negatively impact my opinion and therefore write-up of the game, but please do not let this detract from the efforts of my teammates, especially Kate Mooney, who worked non-stop day and night attempting to organize a completely disparate team, and did an absolutely amazing job at wrangling us.

# Pitch
The pitch for re-Coil is **not** an easy one to follow. A first-person shooter based on an Alternate History version of Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison's rivalry.

Thomas Edison has maimed people into near-lobotomized 'zombies' through his dangerous experiments with Direct Current.

This pitch can be instantly recognized by those sound of mind as 'shaky at best', however as of the beginning of this project, I was in a rather terrible, manic state of mind, so I did not.

This is perhaps my biggest mistake this entire project, and it was the core premise of our work...

I take full responsibility for the pitch not meeting the brief well (if at all), and would like to suggest that my teammates not be marked down on those grounds, as it was entirely my idea.

## Other Pitches
Some other ideas we cycled through were:
- A twisted survival horror exploration game set in the worlds of a more personal hero of mine: Junji Ito, a horror manga artist who has won multiple Eisner awards, and deeply furthered the art of cosmic horror in visual mediums.
- A descent through the works of Dante Alighieri, the famed Italian poet who wrote Inferno, the Divine Comedy, Purgatorio and Paradisio. When you think of Hell in our modern day and age, your vision is likely affected by the legacy of Dante.

Either of these pitches would have been better than the one we ended up with. Junji Ito's would have been a harder sell, but that's a semantic argument of the word 'hero' that I've already spent multiple hours having with tutor Paul C, so I'm not digging that up anymore. A Dante Alighieri game would have been pretty fantastic, if complicated to make and plan.

# Concept Document
My initial concept document was a disaster. I was still in the poor state of mind I mentioned earlier, but that is not an excuse for the sheer lunacy that presented in this document. It is included at the beginning of Kate's much better concept document, despite my protests.

What little there is of it that I didn't scrap describes a game that is poorly thought-out in every aspect, and far more importantly *does not meet the project brief*.

## Katy's Re-write
