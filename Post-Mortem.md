I don't like my D5 project. I think the pitch I gave was flawed at best and I think my work and attitude was sub-par. To explain, if not defend, I was in a very manic, uncontrolled state of mind at the beginning of the project due to a lack of medication. I pitched a bad idea, and executed it poorly, then later came to realize I had shot my entire group in the foot.

  

This game fails on every level. It barely meets the brief that was assigned to us of celebrating a hero, and it doesn't even meet its own pitch. The only reason it is salvageable is due to enormous effort from my teammates, especially Kate Mooney who took over as project lead about halfway through the project and did a fantastic job at wrangling us into a team.Â 

  

Katy's work on this project really cannot be overstated, she worked tirelessly to keep people working and dedicated, even when she was unwell, and sure that the whole endeavour might be hopeless.

  

With literal hours to spare we managed to scrape something passably resembling a response to the brief.

  

I take full responsibility for the project's many flaws, as the original project lead. I should have had a better pitch, I should have argued less, and I should have encouraged my team more.

  

That being said, I can't turn back time to better help my teammates, so instead I will dissect the fruit of their labor.

  

In theory, re-COIL is a cel-shaded, zany, 'boomer-shooter' FPS that greatly exaggerates the rivalry between Edison and Tesla for dramatic effect. You would platform and fight your way through levels set in various locations across Industrial-Revolution era America, while assembling scrap into weaponry based on real Nikola Tesla designs.

  

In practice, it is a bland FPS demo with few selling points. In fact, there is almost no correlation between the finished product and the concept other than the fact that it is a shooter, and the cutscene that directly portrays Tesla and Edison.

  

The choices I made directly affected the quality of the project, and more importantly, the ability of my teammates to use their strengths to make something of quality. The biggest failure of the project is that it doesn't properly show the incredible talent of Katy, Zac and Charli.

  

I hope you will please consider these points when grading them on this assignment.
