# Style
The game is set in the apocalypse, and it has to *feel* like it. The world is in disarray, and survivors are few and far between. Make it feel **abandoned**. Make it feel **hostile**. Draw on *Hostile Architecture*, as well as video game influences like *The Last of Us* or *Bioshock*.

***The Apocalypse of The Last of Us***

## Characters
Monotony is **not sexy**.

Zombies should be covered in flowers, with vibrant pinks, purples and blues.

### Research Tangent:
Plants *love* human corpses. The best way to grow roses is human blood. Plants growing in and through the zombies is not just stylistically beautiful, but an interesting scientific take on zombies.


## Environments
In contrast to the zombies, the environments of the game should be dull and grey. Our focus should be not on **texture** design but **level** design.

Take a page from Hostile Architecture when designing the levels; the levels should feel dilapidated and broken-down, while still being engaging and fun to play.

# Cutting Corners
We are *on the clock*. We cannot afford to make a finished game, so we are making a ***DEMO***. As this paragraph is being written, we are exactly 1 week into the project, with 6 weeks left.

We are making **one, *maybe* two** levels, and polishing them to be as high-quality as possible.

\[TODO: ADD MORE HERE\]

# Gameplay
The name of the game is Resource Management except the game isn't called that.

# Story
The story doesn't need to be The Odyssey. Lean into the silliness, it's a dumb idea, but a dumb idea can be executed well. Silly doesn't mean low quality.

Pride, Prejudice and Zombies is a good point of reference. Silly idea, but a fun, kooky watch.

## Zombies
Okay, yes a very saturated concept. But not without merit! Here is the origin of our zombies:

> Experiments with electricity, just after the Industrial Revolution, led to mindless, shambling corpses walking around. These corpses gradually rotted, before becoming hosts to plants like roses and spider lilies. These plants kept them from rotting completely, but altered their already-reduced brain function, turning them into mindless killers. 
> 
> Now the world has fallen, most plants are dead or dying as nutrients are horded by the plants growing on zombies, and humanity recedes into smaller and smaller pockets.

## Justification
You, be you teammate or assessor, may be wondering: "Does this really meet the brief?".

Yes.

At the end of the day, this premise is all to justify a fun and engaging way of learning about Nikola Tesla.
